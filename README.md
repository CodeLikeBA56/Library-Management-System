# Library Management System (Java - Backend)

This is a **Library Management System** built in **Java** as part of a **Data Structures and Algorithms** project studied in the 3rd semester.  
It is a backend-only system that manages books, users, and transactions.

## ⚙️ Data Structures Used
We manually implemented different data structures to improve **OOP concepts** and strengthen understanding of algorithms.  

- **Books** → Stored in **LinkedList**  
- **Users** → Stored in **ArrayList**  
- **Transactions / Fines** → Stored in **Binary Search Tree (BST)**

## 🎨 Console Output with Colors
- We used **colored outputs** in `System.out.println()` to make system messages more realistic.  
- On some systems, colors may not work, but they work fine on our setup.  
- The purpose is to simulate how **real-world applications** use colors for **warnings, errors, success messages, etc.**

## 📂 Other Implemented Data Structures
Along with the main project, we implemented the following data structures:

0. ArrayList  
1. LinkedList (Simple)  
2. Doubly LinkedList  
3. Circular LinkedList  
4. Stack  
5. Queue using ArrayList  
6. Queue using LinkedList  
7. Queue using Stack  
8. Priority Queue using Min Heap  
9. Priority Queue using Max Heap  
10. Binary Search Tree  
11. Binary Heap
